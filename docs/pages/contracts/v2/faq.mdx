# FAQ(s)

## Q1: Are rebasing token supported?

Yes, rebasing tokens are supported on PancakeSwap V2.

There are two types of rebases:

1. Positive Rebase: Token supply increases.
2. Negative Rebase: Token supply decreases.

PancakeSwap V2 pools maintain an internal reserve state, so after each rebase, it's important to manually update the pool's reserves.

### Syncing After a Rebase

- After a rebase, you should call:

```solidity
pool.sync();
```
This ensures the pool’s internal reserves match the actual token balances.

- For a positive rebase, if the protocol prefers to retain the excess tokens, you can call:

```solidity
pool.skim(address to);
```
This transfers the excess tokens (beyond what the reserves account for) to a specified address instead of updating the reserves.

## Q2: Are fee-on-transfer token supported?

Yes, they are.

When interacting with fee-on-transfer tokens, ensure you use the router functions that support them. 

These functions end with `SupportingFeeOnTransferTokens`, such as:

```solidity
swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens
```

## Q3: Are LP or Protocol Fees Considered Part of V2 Pool Liquidity?

Yes, both LP and protocol fees are considered part of the PancakeSwap V2 pool liquidity.

- LP fees are automatically compounded into the LP position.
- Protocol fees are minted to the protocol as LP tokens, maintaining them within the pool’s liquidity.
