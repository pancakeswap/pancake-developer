## Example of CAKE bridging to Aptos

**sendFrom**


```solidity
function sendFrom(address _from, uint16 _dstChainId, bytes32 _toAddress, uint _amount, uint _minAmount, LzCallParams calldata _callParams) external payable;
```

| Name        | Type    | Description                        |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| _from  | address | From address. This should be the address calling the CakeProxyOFT           |
| _dstChainId    | uint16   | `108` for Aptos mainnet                   |
| _toAddress | bytes32   | The destination address on Aptos |
| _amount | uint256   | Amount of CAKE in WEI. Please note that amounts less than 1e-8 will get dusted |
| _minAmount | uint256   | Minimum receiving amount. We do not charge any fee in CAKE. But this should not be larger than `_amount` after being rounded down to 8 decimals |
| _callParams | tuple   | A set of call parameters used to define bridging behaviours. Continue reading for more detail. |


:::info
`sendFrom` is a payable function. You will need to pay around 0.005-0.01 in BNB for destination airdrop gas fees. This value will vary based on the price of BNB/APT.&#x20;

Please note that if you define extra gas being airdropped to your destination address, you will need to increase this number or tx will revert with `not enough natives for fees`

**How to form \`\_callParams\`**

```solidity
{
    refundAddress,
    zroPaymentAddress,
    adapterParams
}
```

| Name        | Type    | Description                        |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| refundAddress | address | Excess fee (BNB) will be returned to this address            |
| zroPaymentAddress | address   | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`                 |
| adapterParams | bytes   | A set of parameters to define destination gas airdropping. Continue reading for more detail. |


**How to form \`adapterParams\`**

```solidity
{
    version,
    dstGasLimit,
    dstNativeGasTransferAmount,
    dstNativeGasTransferAddress
}
```


| Name        | Type    | Description                        |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `version` | uint16 | Default is 2            |
| dstGasLimit | uint   | Default is `200000`                |
| dstNativeGasTransferAmount | uint   | Amount destination native gas token to airdrop. Use `0` if you don't need the bridge to convert BNB and airdrop you APT |
| dstNativeGasTransferAddress | bytes   | The destination address that receives native gas tokens on destination chain. |



```javascript
const adapterParams = utils.solidityPack(
    ["uint16", "uint", "uint", "bytes"],
    [2, 200000, 0, "0xYourAptosAddress"]
)
```
