## Q1: How can my custom FE take a fee

Assume I build a custom frontend hooked up to this prediction contract, how can I take a fee?

In order to take a fee, one of the option would have to build a proxy contract to take a fee. The interaction would then be your frontend -> your proxy contract -> PCS prediction contract
