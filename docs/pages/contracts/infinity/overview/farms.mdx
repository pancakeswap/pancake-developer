# Farms 

## Overview 

User additional CAKE rewards by providing liquidity to Infinity Pools listed at https://pancakeswap.finance/liquidity/pools?type=1. 

### Farm mechanics

1. **Farm Listing**: The PancakeSwap team registers Infinity Pool farms in the [CampaignManager contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x26Bde0AC5b77b65A402778448eCac2aCaa9c9115) 

2. **Liquidity Provision**: Users add liquidity to Infinity Pools via the [Liquidity Pools & Farms](https://pancakeswap.finance/liquidity/pools?type=1)

3. **Reward Calculation**: Every epoch (8 hours at 00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC), PancakeSwap runs a job to:
    - Calculate fees earned by the pool in the past 8 hours.
    - Determine the CAKE reward for each user based on their liquidity contribution.

4. **Merkle Root Update**: PancakeSwap updates the Merkle root by calling the `setMerkleTree` function on the [Distributor contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xEA8620aAb2F07a0ae710442590D649ADE8440877)

5. Reward Claiming: Users with pending CAKE rewards can call the `claim` function on the [Distributor contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xEA8620aAb2F07a0ae710442590D649ADE8440877) to claim the cake reward.


### Amount of cake earned

The CAKE reward a user earns depends on the proportion of fees their liquidity position (LP) contributes to the total fees in the Infinity Pool.

- Assume the BNB-CAKE pool has 100 CAKE rewards to distribute for the next epoch.
- Alice’s LP generates $10 in fees.
- Bob’s LP generates $40 in fees.
- Alice’s LP accounts for 20% of the total fees ($10 / ($10 + $40) = 0.2). Thus, Alice earns 20% of the CAKE rewards (20 CAKE).

## Integration guide 

This section provides guidance for integrators looking to integrate with PancakeSwap farms.

:::warning
PancakeSwap does not guarantee API uptime, and the interface may change without prior notice.

If you are a protocol interested in launching a farm using your own token as a reward, we encourage you to reach out to the PancakeSwap  to share your feedback. Implementation will be considered based on community demand.

### Fetching the list of farms 

The list of active farms is managed by the [CampaignManager contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x26Bde0AC5b77b65A402778448eCac2aCaa9c9115)

To retrieve the current list of active farms, use one of the following methods:

#### Option 1: Index `CampaignCreated` and `CampaignStopped` events

Monitor the CampaignCreated and CampaignStopped events emitted by the CampaignManager contract. 

```solidity
event CampaignCreated(
    uint256 indexed campaignId,
    IPoolManager indexed poolManager,
    PoolId indexed poolId,
    uint64 startTime,
    uint64 duration,
    uint128 campaignType,
    IERC20 rewardToken,
    int256 totalRewardAmount
);

event CampaignStopped(
    uint256 indexed campaignId, 
    uint128 newDuration, 
    uint256 newTotalRewardAmount
);
```


#### Option 2: Query on-chain 
To retrieve the list of active farms directly from the blockchain, follow these steps:

1. **Fetch Total Campaigns**: Call the `campaignLength` function on the [CampaignManager contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x26Bde0AC5b77b65A402778448eCac2aCaa9c9115) to get the total number of campaigns.

2. **Retrieve Campaign Details**: For each campaignId (from 1 to the total campaign length), call the `campaignInfo(uint256 campaignId)` function to obtain details such as the `poolId, totalReward`.


```solidity
eg. campaignManager.campaignInfo(1);

[ campaignInfo(uint256) method Response ]
  poolManager   address :  0xa0FfB9c1CE1Fe56963B0321B32E7A0302114058b
  poolId   bytes32 :  0xcbc43b950eb089f1b28694324e76336542f1c158ec955921704cebaa53a278bc
  startTime   uint64 :  1742457600
  duration   uint64 :  604800 // in seconds 
  campaignType   uint128 :  0 // will always be 0 for now 
  rewardToken   address :  0x0E09FaBB73Bd3Ade0a17ECC321fD13a19e81cE82
  totalRewardAmount   uint256 :  2100000000000000000
```


### How to claim reward

Prerequisites
- **User Wallet Address**: Ensure you have user's wallet address.
- **Current Time**: Obtain the current timestamp in seconds.


::::steps
#### Step 1: Fetch Merkle proof

To claim rewards from the [Distributor contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xEA8620aAb2F07a0ae710442590D649ADE8440877), first retrieve the Merkle proof for the user's address.

- **Action**: Call the PancakeSwap API to fetch the Merkle proof for the user’s address and the relevant reward distribution period.

```bash
GET https://infinity.pancakeswap.com/farms/users/{chainId}/{user_address}/{current_ts_sec}

// Example
// BNB chainId: 56
// user: 0x42571B8414c68B63A2729146CE93F23639d25399
// Current time in sec: 1747382043 (Tuesday, June 21, 40749 11:16:35.266)
GET https://infinity.pancakeswap.com/farms/users/56/0x42571B8414c68B63A2729146CE93F23639d25399/1747382043
```

It should return the below response:
```json
// Should only return array of 1 item as theres only CAKE as reward token currently
{

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Step 2: Call Distributor contract to claim 

After obtaining the Merkle proof, call the [Distributor contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xEA8620aAb2F07a0ae710442590D649ADE8440877) to claim CAKE rewards.

**Contract Details**:

The claim function allows users to claim their rewards based on the provided parameters. If a user has already claimed a portion of their rewards (e.g., 10 out of 20 CAKE), only the remaining amount (e.g., 10 CAKE) will be distributed.



```solidity
struct ClaimParams {
  address token; // from rewards[0].rewardTokenAddress
  uint256 amount; // from rewards[0].totalRewardAmount
  bytes32[] proof; // from rewards[0].proofs
}

/// @dev if user have already claimed 10 out of 20 cake, user will only get 10 cake from claiming.
function claim(ClaimParams[] calldata claimParams);
```

**Action**:
Construct a ClaimParams array using:

- token: The reward token address (from rewards[0].rewardTokenAddress in the API response).

- amount: The total reward amount (from rewards[0].totalRewardAmount).

- proof: The Merkle proof array (from rewards[0].proofs). Then, call the claim function with the ClaimParams array.
