# Key Differences Between PancakeSwap Infinity and Uniswap v4

This section outlines the high-level architectural and integration differences between PancakeSwap Infinity and Uniswap v4, with a focus on considerations relevant to developers and integrators.

## 1. Pool Type Support 

PancakeSwap Infinity features a modular architecture that enables support for multiple DEX designs.

- PancakeSwap Infinity currently supports both:
    - Concentrated Liquidity Pools
    - Liquidity Book Pools

- Uniswap v4, by contrast, supports only:
    - Concentrated Liquidity Pools

This flexibility in PancakeSwap Infinity allows for future extensibility and experimentation with alternative AMM models.

## 2. Separation of Accounting and AMM Layers 

A core architectural difference lies in how the accounting logic is separated from the AMM logic:

- PancakeSwap Infinity separates concerns by introducing:
    - Vault – handles asset accounting
    - CLPoolManager / BinPoolManager – manage the AMM logic

- Uniswap v4 combines both accounting and AMM logic within a single contract:
    - PoolManager

This separation allows PancakeSwap Infinity to support multiple AMM types more easily and provides a more modular integration pattern.


**Integration Implications**

| Operation                       | PancakeSwap Infinity   | Uniswap v4                       |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Asset Transfer Target           | `Vault` contract       | `PoolManager` contract           |
| Accounting Functions (eg. take) | `vault.take(...)`      | `poolManager.take(...)`          |

Integrators interacting with the accounting layer should take this distinction into account.

### Reference Implementations

For further guidance and practical integration examples, refer to the following smart contracts in the PancakeSwap [Infinity periphery repository](https://github.com/pancakeswap/infinity-periphery):

- [InfinityRouter.sol](https://github.com/pancakeswap/infinity-periphery/blob/main/src/InfinityRouter.sol)

- [CLPositionManager.sol](https://github.com/pancakeswap/infinity-periphery/blob/main/src/pool-cl/CLPositionManager.sol)

- [BinPositionManager.sol](https://github.com/pancakeswap/infinity-periphery/blob/main/src/pool-bin/BinPositionManager.sol)

## 3. PoolKey Struct 

PancakeSwap Infinity and Uniswap v4 define their PoolKey structs differently due to architectural differences, particularly in how they handle pool-specific parameters and hook permissions.

**Key Differences**
- PancakeSwap Infinity uses a unified `bytes32 parameters` field to encode both the hook's permissions and AMM-specific attributes.
- Uniswap v4 uses a dedicated `int24 tickSpacing` field for AMM parameters, with hook permissions handled separately.

PancakeSwap Infinity also include a `poolManager` attribute which is either CLPoolManager or BinPoolManager address.

### Understanding `bytes32 parameters` in PancakeSwap Infinity

In PancakeSwap Infinity, the `parameters` field encapsulates:

- **Hook permissions** (first 16 bits)
- **AMM-specific attributes**, depending on the pool type:
    - **CLPoolManager**: tick spacing (next 24 bits). See [CLPoolParametersHelper](https://github.com/pancakeswap/infinity-core/blob/main/src/pool-cl/libraries/CLPoolParametersHelper.sol)
    - **BinPoolManager**: bin step (next 16 bits). See [BinPoolParameterHelper](https://github.com/pancakeswap/infinity-core/blob/main/src/pool-bin/libraries/BinPoolParametersHelper.sol)


**Example: CLPool: BNB/CAKE with dynamic fee hook**

```solidity
// ref: https://pancakeswap.finance/liquidity/pool/bsc/0x737a7d974a19bafb34c8d74d898188c9b59689b91f291fa6ade69f71fa0f5afa
// PoolId: 0x737a7d974a19bafb34c8d74d898188c9b59689b91f291fa6ade69f71fa0f5afa

// Query poolKey via CLPoolManager.poolIdToPoolKey(bytes32 poolId)
PoolKey: 
[ poolIdToPoolKey(bytes32) method Response ]
  currency0   address :  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  currency1   address :  0x0E09FaBB73Bd3Ade0a17ECC321fD13a19e81cE82
  hooks   address :  0x32C59D556B16DB81DFc32525eFb3CB257f7e493d
  poolManager   address :  0xa0FfB9c1CE1Fe56963B0321B32E7A0302114058b
  fee   uint24 :  8388608
  parameters   bytes32 :  0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a00c2
```

In this example: 

- parameters = `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a00c2`
- **Hook permission**: `0x00c2 → 0000 0000 1100 0010` (in bits)
- **Tick spacing**: 0x00000a → decimal 10


### Interpreting Hook Permissions

Hook permissions occupy the first 16 bits of `parameters`. These bits determine which lifecycle callbacks are enabled.

For **CL pool types**, refer to [ICLHooks](https://github.com/pancakeswap/infinity-core/blob/main/src/pool-cl/interfaces/ICLHooks.sol)

- Example interpretation of `0000 0000 1100 0010`:
    - afterInitialize callback enabled
    - beforeSwap callback enabled
    - afterSwap callback enabled

For **Bin Pool types**, see [IBinHooks](https://github.com/pancakeswap/infinity-core/blob/main/src/pool-bin/interfaces/IBinHooks.sol)

### PoolKey Struct Reference

**PancakeSwap Infinity**
```solidity
struct PoolKey {
    Currency currency0;
    Currency currency1;
    IHooks hooks;
    /// @notice The pool manager of the pool
    IPoolManager poolManager;
    uint24 fee;
    /// @notice Hooks callback and pool specific parameters, i.e. tickSpacing for CL, binStep for bin
    bytes32 parameters;
}
```

**Uniswap v4**
```solidity
struct PoolKey {
    Currency currency0;
    Currency currency1;
    uint24 fee;
    /// @notice Ticks that involve positions must be a multiple of tick spacing
    int24 tickSpacing;
    /// @notice The hooks of the pool
    IHooks hooks;
}
```
