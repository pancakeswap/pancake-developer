# Develop a hook

In this guide, we'll develop a hook for concentrated liquidity pool. The same step will apply for liquidity book. We'll start with introducing hook template before the step by step guide section.

## Hooks template

Proceed to https://github.com/pancakeswap/infinity-hooks-template for the hook template. Click `Use this template` to create a new repository based on the template.

The template requires Foundry. If you don't have Foundry installed, please follow the [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Once the new repository is cloned to local setup, run the following commands:
```bash
> forge install // install dependencies
> forge test // run the existing tests in the repository
```

Within both `src` and `test` there are 2 folders: `pool-cl` and `pool-bin`. If you are developing for concentrated liquidity pool, focus on pool-cl folder, otherwise pool-bin folder for the liquidity book pool type.

### BaseHook
BaseHook is a base contract where you will inherit for your hooks. It provides

1. helper method: `_hooksRegistrationBitmapFrom` to set up the callback required
2. callback method: for you to overwrite

```solidity
// Snippet from CLCounterHook.sol
import {CLBaseHook} from "./CLBaseHook.sol";

contract CLCounterHook is CLBaseHook {

  constructor(ICLPoolManager _poolManager) CLBaseHook(_poolManager) {}

  // 1. Set up callback required. in this case, 4 callback are required
  function getHooksRegistrationBitmap() external pure override returns (uint16) {
    return _hooksRegistrationBitmapFrom(
        Permissions({
            beforeInitialize: false,
            afterInitialize: false,
            beforeAddLiquidity: true,
            afterAddLiquidity: true,
            beforeRemoveLiquidity: false,
            afterRemoveLiquidity: false,
            beforeSwap: true,
            afterSwap: true,
            beforeDonate: false,
            afterDonate: false,
            beforeSwapReturnDelta: false,
            afterSwapReturnDelta: false,
            afterAddLiquidityReturnDelta: false,
            afterRemoveLiquidityReturnDelta: false
        })
    );
  }

  // 2. For each callback required, overwrite the method
  function _beforeAddLiquidity(address, PoolKey calldata key, ICLPoolManager.ModifyLiquidityParams calldata, bytes calldata)
    external override poolManagerOnly returns (bytes4) {
      // implement hook logic and then return selector
      return this.beforeAddLiquidity.selector;
  }
}

```

## Step by step guide

We will develop a hook that allows [veCake](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/vecake/what-is-vecake) holder to get a 50% swap fee discount when swapping through pool with this hook.

---

### Step 1: Download hook template

1. Create a new repository from pancake-infinity-hooks-template: [Click here](https://github.com/new?template_name=infinity-hooks-template&template_owner=pancakeswap) 
2. Clone the repository locally and run `forge install` and `forge test` to verify local setup.

---

### Step 2: Implementation idea

The flow will be as follows:
1. We first initialize the pool via `poolManager.function initialize(PoolKey memory key, uint160 sqrtPriceX96)`, the default swap fee for the pool is by default 0.

2. We will then call `hook.setLpFee(PoolKey memory key, uint24 lpFee)` to set the default swap fee for the pool.

3. At `beforeSwap()`, hook check if the swapper is veCake holder and return the updated swap fee accordingly through `lpFeeOverride` value.

---

### Step 3: Implement the hook

We'll perform the following:

1. Add `beforeSwap` permission
2. Implement `setLpFee()` 
2. Return the swap fee based on whether user is veCake holder in `beforeSwap`

Let's go through the implementation step by step

::::steps
#### 3.1 Add `beforeSwap` permission
Create a file called at `src/pool-cl/VeCakeSwapDiscountHook.sol` and implement the following. The hook contract extends `CLBaseHook`.

```solidity
contract VeCakeSwapDiscountHook is CLBaseHook { // [!code focus]
    function getHooksRegistrationBitmap() external pure override returns (uint16) {
        return _hooksRegistrationBitmapFrom(
            Permissions({
                beforeInitialize: false,
                afterInitialize: false, 
                beforeAddLiquidity: false,
                afterAddLiquidity: false,
                beforeRemoveLiquidity: false,
                afterRemoveLiquidity: false,
                beforeSwap: true, // [!code focus]
                afterSwap: false,
                beforeDonate: false,
                afterDonate: false,
                beforeSwapReturnsDelta: false,
                afterSwapReturnsDelta: false,
                afterAddLiquidityReturnsDelta: false,
                afterRemoveLiquidityReturnsDelta: false
            })
        );
    }
}
```


#### 3.2 Implement `setLpFee()` 

Note that in production, you will want to ensure only authorized user can call `setLpFee`

```solidity
// mapping to store poolId 
mapping(PoolId => uint24) public poolIdToLpFee;

/// @notice Update the lp fee for a pool
/// @dev warning: in production, ensure this function is only callable by authorized user
function setLpFee(PoolKey calldata key, uint24 lpFee) external {
  poolIdToLpFee[key.toId()] = lpFee;
}
```

#### 3.3 Return the lp fee based on whether user is veCake holder in `beforeSwap`
`beforeSwap` will be called before a swap happens, and the third return value `uint24 lpFeeOverride` is where we can override the swap fee.

Note the return value need to include `LPFeeLibrary.OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG` so pool manager knows the intention is to override swap fee.

```solidity
function beforeSwap(address, PoolKey calldata key, ICLPoolManager.SwapParams calldata, bytes calldata)
    external view override poolManagerOnly returns (bytes4, BeforeSwapDelta, uint24)
{
    uint24 lpFee = poolIdToLpFee[key.toId()];

    if (veCake.balanceOf(tx.origin) >= 1 ether) {
        lpFee = lpFee / 2; 
    }

    return (this.beforeSwap.selector, BeforeSwapDeltaLibrary.ZERO_DELTA, lpFee | LPFeeLibrary.OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG);
}
```

```solidity [src/pool-cl/VeCakeSwapDiscountHook.sol]
// [!include ~/snippets/VeCakeSwapDiscountHook.sol]
```

</details>

---

### Step 4: Add Hook test

In the test, we'll test 2 scenarios:

1. when swapping as a normal user
1. when swapping as a veCake holder

Create a file called at `test/pool-cl/VeCakeSwapDiscountHook.t.sol` and copy content from below.

<details>
    <summary> View complete source code here </summary>
    <Callout type="warning">
        The assertion in the test has been simplified, in the real world, you should calculate the `amtOut` and verify it.
    </Callout>

```solidity [test/pool-cl/VeCakeSwapDiscountHook.t.sol]
// [!include ~/snippets/VeCakeSwapDiscountHook.t.sol]
```
</details>

In order to allow dynamic swap fee, the `fee` variable in poolKey must have dynamic flag set.

```solidity
key = PoolKey({
    currency0: currency0,
    currency1: currency1,
    hooks: hook,
    poolManager: poolManager,
    fee: LPFeeLibrary.DYNAMIC_FEE_FLAG, // [!code focus]
    parameters: bytes32(uint256(hook.getHooksRegistrationBitmap())).setTickSpacing(10)
});
```

---

### Step 5: Verify

Run `forge test` to verify test passing.
