# Overwrite amm-curve via hook

In this guide, we'll build a hook which overwrites the default pricing curve by the AMM. This guide assume you have read [develop-a-hook](/contracts/infinity/guides/develop-a-hook) guide.

<Callout type="info">
[Hook return delta](/contracts/infinity/overview/custom-layer-hook#hook-return-delta) feature will be used in this guide. Do read up on the page before starting on this guide.
</Callout>

### Requirements

1.A new protocol has a new stablecoin and wants to leverage PCS infrastructure to allow users to swap between their stablecoin and USDC with 0 slippage.

2. This mimics the typical mint/redeem functionality available in other protocols.

3. To keep this guide simple, there will not be any fees from the hook.

## Step by Step guide

### Step 1: Implementation idea

Within `beforeSwap()` callback: we'll check how much amount user are swapping and return the appropriate BalanceDelta.

For example if the user swap `exactIn 100 token0 for token1` with `-100 amountSpecified`, beforeSwap() will return BeforeSwapDelta of (100, -100). User will then get 100 tokenOut in this case implying a 1:1 swap. 


### Step 2: Implement the hook

Take note of 

1. The hook permission which includes `beforeSwapReturnsDelta` as the hook modify the delta in beforeSwap.
2. How the hook take/settle the currency and the BeforeSwapDelta returned.

### Step 3: Write the test 

The test is straight-forward, with 4 test cases of swapping exactIn / exactOut and zeroForOne / oneForZero.
