# FAQ(s)

## Q1: Are rebasing token supported?

Rebasing tokens are not natively supported in v4.

- **Negative Rebase:** The recorded balance in reserveOfApp[app][currency] will exceed the actual vault amount, causing LP losses.
- **Positive Rebase:** LPs will not receive the extra rebased tokens, which will remain stuck in the vault.

You will need a custom token wrapper for rebasing tokens, or consider using PCS v2 instead.

## Q2: Are fee-on-transfer token supported?

Fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported on our router.

- The router transfers tokens based on the BalanceDelta from the operation and settles with the vault.
- If there's a transfer fee, the token amount in the vault post-transfer will be less than intended, causing a CurrencyNotSettled() error in vault accounting.

You will need to build a custom router or use a custom token wrapper for such tokens.

## Q3: How is protocol fee charged in v4? 

Protocol fee is set on the pool during:

- **Initialization**: PoolManager fetches the protocol fee from ProtocolFeeController when a pool is initialized.
- **Update**: ProtocolFeeController can update the protocol fee for a pool at any time.

Protocol fee is a uint24 with:

- Upper 12 bits for `oneForZero` fee.
- Lower 12 bits for `zeroForOne` fee.

Maximum protocol fee: `1000 (0.1%)` on token0 or token1, depending on swap direction:

- Swap token0 for token1: fee on token0 (`zeroForOne` fee).
- Swap token1 for token0: fee on token1 (`oneForZero` fee).

## Q4: How is swap fee (or lpFee) charged in v4? 

- Setting the Fee: Pool creator can either sets a fixed fee in poolKey.fee (e.g., 3000 means 0.3% swap fee), or [dynamic fee](/contracts/v4/overview/custom-layer-hook#dynamic-lp-swap-fee)

Swap fee application:

- Swap token0 for token1: fee on token0.
- Swap token1 for token0: fee on token1.

When both protocol fee and swap fee are present:

1. Protocol fee is taken from the input amount first.
2. LP fee is taken from the remaining amount after deducting the protocol fee.
