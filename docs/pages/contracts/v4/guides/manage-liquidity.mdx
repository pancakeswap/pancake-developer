# Manage liquidity for CL and Bin pool

We'll make use of periphery contracts from [v4-periphery](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery) for liquidity management in v4.

The topic would include:

1. Permit2 integration
2. PositionManager execution flow
3. Type of cl pool liquidity actions (`CLPositionManager`)
4. Type of bin pool liquidity actions (`BinPositionManager`)
5. Type of settlement actions (applicable for both pool type)

## 1. Permit2 integration
Both [CLPositionManager](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/pool-cl/CLPositionManager.sol) and [BinPositionManager](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/pool-bin/BinPositionManager.sol) integrates with [Permit2](/contracts/permit2)

**Frontend**

For Frontend, this means that when performing any operation that involves taking token from the user, user needs to sign a permit message and pass that signature in the multiCall. 

Example:

```solidity
bytes[] memory calls = new bytes[](2);

// signature from user
calls[0] = abi.encodeWithSelector(IAllowanceTransfer.Permit.selector, owner, PermitSingle permitSIngle, bytes signature);
// modifyLiquidites call - explained in next section
calls[1] = abi.encodeWithSelector(IPositionManager.modifyLiquidities.selector, abi.encode(...));

positonManager.multiCall(...)
```

**Solidity**
For contract calls to CLPositionManager, call permit2.approve positionManager. 

```solidity 
// call permit2.approve(address token, address spender, uint160 amount, uint48 expiration);
// example infinite approval to clPositionManager
permit2.approve(tokenAddress, address(clPositionManager), type(uint160).max, type(uint48).max));
```

Frontend can also follow this approach, however this means its a 2 step process for user:

- Step 1: call permit2.approve
- Step 2: call clPositionManager.modifyLiquidites

## 2. PositionManager execution flow

If you are familar with universal router, PositionManager follows the same approach (one method, with actions and params).

```solidity 
// @notice Unlocks Vault and batches actions for modifying liquidity
function modifyLiquidities(bytes calldata payload, uint256 deadline) external payable;

// @notice Batches actions for modifying liquidity without getting a lock from vault
function modifyLiquiditiesWithoutLock(bytes calldata actions, bytes[] calldata params) external payable;
```

The `payload` in `modifyLiquidities` is `abi.encode(actions, params)` of the input in `modifyLiquiditiesWithoutLock(bytes calldata actions, bytes[] calldata params)`

- List of `actions` can be found [here](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/libraries/Actions). Actions includes liquidity related `CL_INCREASE_LIQUIDITY` or settlement related such as `SETTLE_PAIR`. 

- `bytes[] params` is an array of bytes string. Each element in the array is the abi-encoded input for each respective action.


Given `actions = 0x021717`, it would mean 3 actions processed in order:

1. 02: CL_MINT_POSITION
2. 17: CLOSE_CURRENCY
3. 17: CLOSE_CURRENCY

With 3 actions, it would mean `bytes[] params` of length = 3.

1. param[0] = abi encoded param of CL_MINT_POSITION action 
1. param[1] = abi encoded param of CLOSE_CURRENCY action 
1. param[2] = abi encoded param of CLOSE_CURRENCY action 

### Example

The example tries to mint a position with CLPositionManager and uses [Planner](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/libraries/Planner.sol) which is a helper class to build actions. 

```solidity
PositionConfig memory config = PositionConfig({poolKey: key, tickLower: tickLower, tickUpper: tickUpper});

// Assume other field such as liquidity and amount0Max are present
Plan memory planner = Planner.init();

// For each action to add, call planner.add 
planner.add(ACTIONS.CL_MINT_POSITION, abi.encode(config, liquidity, amount0Max, amount1Max, recipient, hookData));

// finalizeModifyLiquidityWithClose is a helper method to add CLOSE_CURRENCY actions for both currencies  
bytes memory payload = planner.finalizeModifyLiquidityWithClose(config.poolKey)

uint256 deadline = block.timestamp;
clPositionManager.modifyLiquidities(payload, deadline);
```

## 3. Type of CL pool liquidity actions (`CLPositionManager`)

Below list down CL pool related actions and its associated params.  

Before we proceed, `PositionConfig` is a commonly used struct in CL liquidity related so we'll document here once

```solidity
struct PositionConfig {
  PoolKey poolKey;
  int24 tickLower;
  int24 tickUpper;
}
```

### CL_MINT_POSITION
Mint a new position
```solidity
{
  PositionConfig config; // config for the position 
  uint256 liquidity; // the amount of liquidity to increase
  uint128 amount0Max; // max amount0, revert if amount0 exceeds amount0Max
  uint128 amount1Max; // max amount1, revert if amount1 exceeds amount1Max
  address owner; // owner to recieve the minted NFT  
  bytes hookData: // hook data to pass to hook, or empty bytes if nothing to pass
}
```

### CL_BURN_POSITION
Burn the NFT and automatically decrease liquidity to 0 if the position is not already empty.
```solidity
{
  uint256 tokenId; // the NFT tokenId to burn
  PositionConfig config; // config for the position 
  uint128 amount0Min; // min amount0, revert if less than amount0Min is removed
  uint128 amount1Min: min amount1, revert if less than amount1Min is removed
  bytes hookData: // hook data to pass to hook, or empty bytes if nothing to pass
}
```


### CL_INCREASE_LIQUIDITY
Increase liquidity from existing position
```solidity
{
  uint256 tokenId; // the NFT tokenId to increase liquidity 
  PositionConfig config; // config for the position 
  uint256 liquidity; // the amount of liquidity to increase
  uint128 amount0Max; // max amount0, revert if more than amount0Max is added
  uint128 amount1Max: max amount1, revert if more than amount1Max is added
  bytes hookData: // hook data to pass to hook, or empty bytes if nothing to pass
}
```

### CL_DECREASE_LIQUIDITY
Decrease liquidity from existing position
```solidity
{
  uint256 tokenId; // the NFT tokenId to decrease liquidity 
  PositionConfig config; // config for the position 
  uint256 liquidity; // the amount of liquidity to decrease
  uint128 amount0Min; // min amount0, revert if less than amount0Min is removed
  uint128 amount1Min: min amount1, revert if less than amount1Min is removed
  bytes hookData: // hook data to pass to hook, or empty bytes if nothing to pass
}
```

## 4. Type of Bin pool liquidity actions (`BinPositionManager`)
Add liqudiity, will mint the correspond ERC-1155 token.
### BIN_ADD_LIQUIDITY
```solidity 
IBinPositionManager.BinAddLiquidityParams {
  PoolKey poolKey; // struct which identify the pool
  uint128 amount0; // amount of token0 
  uint128 amount1;  // amount of token1 
  uint128 amount0Min; // min amount of token0, revert if required token is lesser
  uint128 amount1Min; // min amount of token1, revert if required token is lesser
  uint256 activeIdDesired; // active id preferred when adding liquidity
  uint256 idSlippage; // max slippage on active id, revert if activeId changes more than idSlippage value
  int256[] deltaIds; // list of delta ids to add liquidity (deltaId = activeId - desiredId). see helper method convertToRelative above
  uint256[] distributionX; // distribution of token0 with sum(distributionX) = 100e18 (100%)
  uint256[] distributionY; // distribution of token1 with sum(distributionY) = 100e18 (100%)
  address to; // address of recipient to receive the 1155 token which represent ownership of liquidity
}
```

### BIN_REMOVE_LIQUIDITY
Remove liquidity, will burn the corresponding ERC-1155 token.

```solidity
IBinPositionManager.BinRemoveLiquidityParams {
  PoolKey poolKey; // struct which identify the pool
  uint128 amount0Min; // min amount of token0 to receive, revert if required token is lesser
  uint128 amount1Min; // min amount of token1 to receive, revert if required token is lesser
  uint256[] ids; // list of bin ids
  uint256[] amounts; // list of lquidity to remove for each bin
  address from; // Address of holder who owns the 1155 token
}
```

## 5. Type of settlement actions 

These action are applicable for both CLPositionManager and BinPositionManager.

### SETTLE_PAIR
Pay and settle currency pair. User's token0 and token1 will be transferred from user and paid. This is commonly used for increase liquidity or mint action.
```solidity
{
  Currency currency0; // address of currency0
  Currency currency1; // address of currency1
}
```

### TAKE_PAIR
Take all amount owed from currency pair. Owed token0 and token1 will be transfered to `to`. This is commonly used for decrease liquidity or burn action.
```solidity
{
  Currency currency0; // address of currency0
  Currency currency1; // address of currency1
  address to; // recipient of the tokens 
}
```
### SETTLE 
Pay and settle currency. 

For amount, there are constants [ActionConstants](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/libraries/ActionConstants.sol).

- `amount=ActionConstants.CONTRACT_BALANCE`: amount will be currency.balance(positionManager)
- `amount=ActionConstants.OPEN_DELTA`: amount will be the outstanding amount  

```solidity
{
  Currency currency; // address of currency to settle 
  uint256 amount; // amount to settle
  bool payerIsUser; // if true, transfer token from msgSender(), otherwise from positionManager 
}
```

### TAKE 
Take all amount owed from currency.

For amount, there are constants [ActionConstants](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/libraries/ActionConstants.sol).

- `amount=ActionConstants.OPEN_DELTA`: amount will be the owed amount  

```solidity
{
  Currency currency; // address of currency to take 
  address recipient; // recipient of the token taken 
  uint256 amount; // amount to take
}
```

### CLOSE_CURRENCY 
Close currency by either take or settle so debt is netted off. If take, token will be sent to caller, if settle, token will be transferred from caller.

```solidity
{
  Currency currency; // currency to close 
}
```

### CLEAR_OR_TAKE 

Either take amount owed from currency or forfeit the amount. 

Users might opt to forfeit as the gas cost might of erc20 transfer is higher than the amount taken.

```solidity
{
  Currency currency; // currency to clear or take 
  uint256 amountMax; // forfeit if the amount to take is lesser than this 
}
```


## 6. Other actions 

### SWEEP 
Transfer any outstanding token balance in positionManager to `to`. 

```solidity
{
  Currency currency; // currency to sweep
  address to; // recipient 
}
```
