# Taking a fee via hook

In this guide, we'll build a hook which takes a fee when user remove liquidity. This guide assume you have read [develop-a-hook](/contracts/v4/guides/develop-a-hook) guide.

<Callout type="info">
[Hook return delta](/contracts/v4/overview/custom-layer-hook#hook-return-delta) feature will be used in this guide. Do read up on the page before starting on this guide.
</Callout>

### Requirements

1. The hook needs to take 10% amt0 and amt1 whenever user removes liquidity. 

## Step by Step guide

### Step 1: Implementation idea

In the `afterRemoveLiquidity()` callback, we calculate the fee based on the amount the user receives from liquidity removal. This amount can be found in the BalanceDelta delta parameter.

```solidity
function afterRemoveLiquidity
    (address sender,
    PoolKey calldata key,
    ICLPoolManager.ModifyLiquidityParams calldata params,
    BalanceDelta delta,
    bytes calldata hookData
) external override poolManagerOnly returns (bytes4, BalanceDelta) {

    // calculate how much fee
    uint128 amt0Fee = uint128(delta.amount0()) / 10;
    uint128 amt1Fee = uint128(delta.amount1()) / 10;
```

### Step 2: Implement the hook

Take note of 

1. The hook permission which includes `afterRemoveLiquidityReturnsDelta` as the hook modify the delta in afterRemoveLiquidity().

### Step 3: Write the test 

The test is straight-forward, add liquidity first then remove liquidity and verify fee is taken.
