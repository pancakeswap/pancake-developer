# Liquidity and swap for concentrated liquidity pool

In this guide, We'll make use of periphery contracts from [v4-periphery](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery)

1. Liquidity operations with `NonFungiblePositionManager`
2. Swaps via `CLSwapRouter`

<Callout type="info">
  Before calling any of the functions below, do approve either NonFungiblePositionManager or SwapRouter.

## Liquidity operations

[NonFungiblePositionManager](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/pool-cl/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol)

### Mint

Create a new position wrapped in a NFT. If you have minted previously, consider `increaseLiquidity()` to add liquidity to the same NFT tokenId.

```solidity
INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams memory params = INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams({
  poolKey: key,
  tickLower: tickLower,
  tickUpper: tickUpper,
  salt: bytes32(0),
  amount0Desired: amount0,
  amount1Desired: amount1,
  amount0Min: 0,
  amount1Min: 0,
  recipient: address(this),
  deadline: block.timestamp
});

(uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
    = nfp.mint(params);
```

Input:

- `poolKey`: struct which identify the pool
- `tickLower | tickUpper`: add liquidity from tickLower to tickUpper
- `salt`: Add extra information to the position, for most use cases, set as `bytes32(0)` is sufficient. 
- `amount0Desired | amount1Desired`: intended amt0 and amt1
- `amount0Min | amount1Min`: minimum amt0 and amt1. transaction will revert if the amount is less than that. In the real-world, set a realistic amount instead of `0`.
- `recipient`: who to receive the NFT which represent ownership of this position
- `deadline`: deadline of this transaction. transaction will revert if `block.timestamp` is greater than `deadline`

Output:

- `tokenId`: NFT tokenId minted
- `liquidity`: total liquidity minted
- `amount0`: amount for token0 taken for minting
- `amount1`: amount for token1 taken for minting

### Decrease liquidity
Decreases the amount of liquidity in a position and accounts it to the position

```solidity
INonfungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams memory params = INonfungiblePositionManager
  .DecreaseLiquidityParams({
    tokenId: tokenId,
    liquidity: liquidity,
    amount0Min: 0,
    amount1Min: 0,
    deadline: type(uint256).max
});

(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = nfp.decreaseLiquidity(params);
```

Input:

- `tokenId`: the NFT tokenId, received when called .mint() earlier
- `liquidity`: amount of liquidity to remove
- `amount0Min | amount1Min`: minimum amt0 and amt1, transaction will revert if the amount is less than that
- `deadline`: deadline of this transaction. transaction will revert if `block.timestamp` is greater than `deadline`


Output:

- `amount0`: amount for token0 received for decreasing liquidity
- `amount1`: amount for token1 received for decreasing liquidity

### Increase liquidity
Increases the amount of liquidity in a position, with tokens paid by the `msg.sender`

```solidity
INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams memory params = INonfungiblePositionManager
  .IncreaseLiquidityParams({
    tokenId: tokenId,
    amount0Desired: amount0,
    amount1Desired: amount1,
    amount0Min: 0,
    amount1Min: 0,
    deadline: block.timestamp
});

(uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = nfp.increaseLiquidity(params);
```

Input:

- `tokenId`: the NFT tokenId, received when called .mint() earlier
- `amount0Desired | amount1Desired`: intended amt0 and amt1
- `amount0Min | amount1Min`: minimum amt0 and amt1, transaction will revert if the amount is less than that
- `deadline`: deadline of this transaction. transaction will revert if `block.timestamp` is greater than `deadline`

Output:
- `liquidity`: amount of liquidity added
- `amount0`: amount for token0 taken for increasing liquidity
- `amount1`: amount for token1 taken for increasing liquidity


### Burn

Burns a token ID, which deletes it from the NFT contract. The token must have 0 liquidity and all tokens

```solidity
nfp.burn(uint256 tokenId);
```


## Swaps

[CLSwapRouter](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/pool-cl/CLSwapRouter.sol)


### Exact Input Single
Swaps `amountIn` of one token for as much as possible of another token

```solidity
ICLSwapRouterBase.V4CLExactInputSingleParams memory params = ICLSwapRouterBase
  .V4CLExactInputSingleParams({
    poolKey: key1,
    zeroForOne: true,
    recipient: address(this),
    amountIn: 1 ether,
    amountOutMinimum: 0,
    sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0,
    hookData: new bytes(0)
});

uint256 amtOut = router.exactInputSingle(params, block.timestamp);
```


Input:

- `poolKey`: struct which identify the pool
- `zeroForOne`: if true swap token0 for token1, else swap token1 for token0
- `recipient`: address to receive the output token
- `amountIn`: desired amount in
- `amountOutMinimum`: min amount out. transaction revert if amount out is lesser
- `sqrtPriceLimitX96`: limit for the price the swap will push the pool to. this help to reduce slippage.
- `hookData`: if set, will be passed to hooks in both beforeSwap and afterSwap
- `deadline`: deadline of this transaction. transaction will revert if `block.timestamp` is greater than `deadline`

Output:

- `amountOut`: amount of token out from the swap

### Exact Input

Swaps `amountIn` of one token for as much as possible of another along the specified path

```solidity
bytes32 params;

ISwapRouterBase.PathKey[] memory path = new ISwapRouterBase.PathKey[](2);
path[0] = ISwapRouterBase.PathKey({
  intermediateCurrency: currency1,
  fee: uint24(3000),
  hooks: IHooks(address(0)),
  hookData: new bytes(0),
  poolManager: poolManager,
  parameters: params.setTickSpacing(10)
});

path[1] = ISwapRouterBase.PathKey({
  intermediateCurrency: currency2,
  fee: uint24(3000),
  hooks: IHooks(address(0)),
  hookData: new bytes(0),
  poolManager: poolManager,
  parameters: params.setTickSpacing(10)
});

ICLSwapRouterBase.V4CLExactInputParams memory input = ICLSwapRouterBase
  .V4CLExactInputParams({
    currencyIn: currency0,
    path: path,
    recipient: address(this),
    amountIn: 1 ether,
    amountOutMinimum: 0
});

uint256 amountOut = router.exactInput(input, block.timestamp);
```

Input:

- `currencyIn`: input token
- `path`: Array of `PathKey[]` which describe the pool to hop
- `recipient`: address to receive the output token
- `amountIn`: desired amount in
- `amountOutMinimum`: min amount out. transaction revert if amount out is lesser

Output:
- `amountOut`: amount of token out from the swap

```solidity
ICLSwapRouterBase.V4CLExactOutputSingleParams memory input = ICLSwapRouterBase
  .V4CLExactOutputSingleParams({
    poolKey: key1,
    zeroForOne: false,
