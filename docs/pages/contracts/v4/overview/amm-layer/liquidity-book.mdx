# Liquidity Book

## Overview 

In liquidity book AMM type, liquidity providers (LPs) have the flexibility to add liquidity in any shapes in a single call. Whereas liquidity are added in a uniform manner across the chosen price range for concentrated liquidity type.

To add liquidity, LPs will specify a byte32 liquidityConfigs array. Each item in the array would indicate which bin and the percentage of amountIn would be added to this bin. For more details, see guides section on liquidity book.

```solidity
struct MintParams {
  // see more at LiquidityConfigurations.sol
  //   [0 - 24[: id
  //   [24 - 88[: distributionY - 1e18 represent 100% of token into this bin
  //   [88 - 152[: distributionX - 1e18 represent 100% of token into this bin 
  //   [152 - 256[: empty
  bytes32[] liquidityConfigs;

  // amountIn intended
  bytes32 amountIn;
  
  // the salt to distinguish different mint from the same owner
  bytes32 salt;
}

/// @dev see more at BinPoolManager.sol 
function mint(PoolKey memory key, IBinPoolManager.MintParams calldata params, bytes calldata hookData);
```

## Concepts

### Bin

![Liquidity book](/v4/amm-layer-poolmanager-bin-1.png)

Think of bin as bucket where liquidity reside and there are a finite number of bins for each pool. Each bin has a price and id associated. 

<Callout type="info">
If a trade happen within a bin, it will incur 0 slippge. However if the trade consume all the liquidity within the bin and cross over to the next bin, there will be slippage.
</Callout>

### Bin Step

Bin step define the minimum price movement between two adjacent bin. This is one of the parameter in `PoolKey`. Keep in mind that there are trade off. While smaller bin steps allow for more precise positioning of liquidity, it might come with higher gas cost potentially (in liquidity and swap operation). Larger bin step could be cheaper on gas but comes with higher slippage in trade execution potentially.

| Bin Step | Price movement between bin |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 |  0.01% |
| 10 | 0.1% |
| 20  | 0.2% |
| 100  | 1% |

Upon initial deployment, the largest `BIN_STEP` for a pool can be 100. The limit can be raised in the future through governance process.

### Bin Active id

Think of `activeId` as the current bin id. To retrieve the activeId of the bin

```solidity 
// ref: BinPoolManager.sol
binPoolManager.getSlot0(PoolId) external 
  returns (uint24 activeId, uint16 protocolFee, uint24 swapFee);
```

### Bin Pricing 

Given the current `activeId` and `binStep`, we can calculate the current price of the pool.

```solidity
price: (1 + binStep / 10_000) ** (activeId - 8388608)
```

Example: USDT/USDC pool with bin step = 1 and activeId = 8388608

```solidity
price: (1 + 1 / 10_000) ** (8388608 - 8388608) = 1
// this means 1 USDT = 1 USDC 
```

### Bin Liquidity 

Liquidity is concentrated in discrete price bins, unlike the continuous price ranges in other AMM types like concentrated liquidity type. Each bin holds a constant sum of assets, allowing for zero slippage trades.

```solidity
// price is the price of the bin.
// x is amount of tokenX 
// y is amount of tokenY 
Liquidity = price * x + y
```

Example: USDT/USDC pool with bin step = 1 and activeId = 8388608 with 100 usdc and 50 usdt (assume 6 decimal place).

```solidity
// price from above example
Liquidity = price * x + y
          = 1 * 100e6 + 50e6
          = 150e6
```

To retrieve the liquidity and reserve of a bin, take note of the result within the code, it is a 128.128-binary fixed-point number.

```solidity
// ref: BinPoolManager.sol
binPoolManager.getBin(PoolId id, uint24 binId)
  returns (uint128 binReserveX, uint128 binReserveY, uint256 binLiquidity);
```

### Composition fee

When liquidity is added to the current active binId and does not add in the current bin tokenY and tokenX ratio, a "swap" will occur when liquidity is being added.

This "swap" will incur composition fee. The fee is the same as typical swap (lp + protocol) fee.

For example 
1. Current active bin reserve is `[1,000e18 token0, 1000e18 token1]` 
2. User add `[500e18 token0, 400e18 token1]`
3. As user add in the ratio with more token0, there'll be a composition fee which arise from swapping some token0 to token1 in the active bin.

For more details, see the calculation over in [BinHelper.sol](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-core/blob/df64445/src/pool-bin/libraries/BinHelper.sol#L175)

### Fungible liquidity

An advantage of Liquidity book is the fungible liquidity. Fungible liquidity provides flexibility in downstream defi application. When LPs add liquidity via `BinFungiblePositionManager.sol`, they get ERC1155 token.

```solidity
/// Ref BinFungibleToken.sol (similar to ERC1155)
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) internal {
  totalSupply[id] += amount;
  unchecked {
    balanceOf[to][id] += amount;
  }
}
```

See [BinFungiblePositionManager](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/pool-bin/BinFungiblePositionManager.sol#L189) on how a token is minted to the liquidity provider.
