  ///   [0 - 24[: id
  ///   [24 - 88[: distributionY - 1e18 represent 100% of token into this bin
  ///   [88 - 152[: distributionX - 1e18 represent 100% of token into this bin 
  ///   [152 - 256[: empty
  bytes32[] liquidityConfigs;

  /// @dev amountIn intended
  bytes32 amountIn;
}

/// @dev see more at BinPoolManager.sol 
function mint(PoolKey memory key, IBinPoolManager.MintParams calldata params, bytes calldata hookData);
