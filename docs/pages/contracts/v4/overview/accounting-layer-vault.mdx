# Accounting Layer | Vault

At the core of this architecture is the 
[Vault](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-core/blob/main/src/Vault.sol), which functions as an immutable accounting layer. It maintains a ledger of tokens that are either deposited or owed, facilitating a secure and efficient settlement process at the end of each transaction.

## Lock Mechanism 

One of the key mechaism in the vault is the **lock mechanism**. User need to get a lock from the vault before performing any operation (swap, liquidity or donate) with the pool manager.

The high level steps are as follow: 

1. Acquire a lock from the vault via `vault.lock()` and the vault will perform a callback to the caller `lockAcquired(data)` 

2. Within `lockAcquired(data)`, caller perform action such as swap `clPoolManager.swap(...)` or liquidity `clPoolManager.modifyLiquidity(..)`

3. The poolManager will inform vault of the balance changes through `vault.accountPoolBalanceDelta(...)`w

4. Caller will then need to reconcile the balance with the vault through either of the 4 methods: `take(), settle(), mint() or burn()`.

// An example of the 4 steps process, some codes are removed to keep this simple
// Ref: https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-periphery/blob/main/src/pool-bin/BinFungiblePositionManager.sol 
contract BinFungiblePositionManager {
    function addLiquidity(AddLiquidity calldata params) external {
        // Step 1: Get a lock
        vault.lock(..)
    }

    function lockAcquired(bytes calldata rawData) external {
        // Step 2: Perform action with pool manager
        CallbackData memory data = abi.decode(rawData, (CallbackData));
        (BalanceDelta delta, ) = poolManager.mint(...)

        // Step 4: Reconcile balance, an example of token0 below
        if (delta.amount0() > 0) {
            // transfer token0 to the vault first then call vault.settle
            vault.settle(poolKey.currency0, user, uint128(delta.amount0()))
        } else {
            vault.take(poolKey.currency0, user, uint128(-delta.amount0()))
        }
    }
}
```


## Reconciling net balance

BalanceDelta is returned whenever you perform some actions with [poolManager](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-core/blob/main/src/pool-cl/CLPoolManager.sol), eg. `swap | modifyLiquidity | donate`. It contains `int128 amount0` and `int128 amount1` that we need to take or settle with the vault.

### Negative balance delta
In this case, vault owe the caller the amount of token. Caller have 2 choices:

1. `vault.take(Currency currency, address to, uint256 amount)` - this will transfer the owed token to the address. 

2. `vault.mint(Currency currency, address to, uint256 amount)` - this will store the surplus token on the vault.

### Positive balance delta
In this case, caller owe the vault the amount of token. You have 2 choices:

1. Transfer token to the vault and call `vault.settle(Currency token)`

2. Assuming caller have done `vault.mint` earlier to store surplus token on the vault, caller can call `vault.burn(Currency currency, uint256 amount)` now to use those surplus token stored in vault.

### When to use `take/mint/settle/burn`?

It really depends on your use case, for most use case, `take/settle` works. However if you are someone who trades a lot with your own contract (eg. arbitrage trader), you can consider `mint/burn` to save on the gas cost by reducing the number of ERC-20 token transfer.
