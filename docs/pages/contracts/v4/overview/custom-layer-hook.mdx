# Custom Layer | Hook

Hooks allow developers to add customization to a pool by having callbacks in the various stage of the lifecycle. There are 10 possible callbacks before / after 5 key actions which happen in an AMM. The key actions include pool initialization, swap, addLiquidity, removeLiquidity and Donate

<Callout type="info">
  The image below shows the list of callbacks for concentrated liquidity pool. Liquidity book pool has similar callback with slightly different name. See bin hook here: https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-core/blob/main/src/pool-bin/interfaces/IBinHooks.sol

## Initialize a pool with hook

In order to initialize a pool with the hook, there are a few pointers to note:

1. Have the hook contract deployed (no address mining is required) and the callback required defined in `getHooksRegistrationBitmap` method

```solidity
/// @dev Below indicate `beforeSwap` callback required
function getHooksRegistrationBitmap() external pure override returns (uint16) {
  return _hooksRegistrationBitmapFrom(
    Permissions({
      beforeInitialize: false,
      afterInitialize: false,
      beforeAddLiquidity: false,
      afterAddLiquidity: false,
      beforeRemoveLiquidity: false,
      afterRemoveLiquidity: false,
      beforeSwap: true, // beforeSwap enabled // [!code hl]
      afterSwap: false,
      beforeDonate: false,
      afterDonate: false,
      noOp: false
    })
  );
}
```

2. When initializing the pool, specify the hook contract in the pool key and remember to call `hook.getHooksRegistrationBitmap()` in parameters so the callback are saved in `PoolKey`.

```solidity 
key = PoolKey({
  currency0: currency0,
  currency1: currency1,
  hooks: hook, // hook contract address 
  poolManager: poolManager,
  fee: uint24(3000), // 0.3% swap fee 
  // parameters include hook callback and tickSpacing: 10
  parameters: bytes32(uint256(hook.getHooksRegistrationBitmap())).setTickSpacing(10)
});

/// Initialize the pool 
poolManager.initialize(key, Constants.SQRT_RATIO_1_1, new bytes(0));
```

## FAQ(s)

-----

**Q1: Can the hook contract be at any address?**

Hook can be deployed on any address. The callback permission required are defined in `poolkey.parameters` and are immutable. Any changes to callback permission will require a new pool.

-----

**Q2: Can you explain more about `poolKey.parameters`?**

`poolKey.parameters` is a bytes32 parameters which includes hook callback required and the format is as follows:

```solidity 
// first 16 bits for hooks callback 
[0 - 15]: reserve for hooks callback

// other bits can be used by each pool type. eg.
[16 - 39] concentrated liquidity pool tick spacing 
[16 - 31] bin pool bin step  
[16 - xx] other new pool type config
```

For example in `ICLHooks.sol`, if the bit 0 is has the value of 1, beforeInitialise callback is required.

```solidity 
uint8 constant HOOKS_BEFORE_INITIALIZE_OFFSET = 0;
```

However, all of this are made easier for you! eg. To define callback required in parameters simply overwrite `getHooksRegistrationBitmap` in your hooks and call `hooks.getHooksRegistrationBitmap` shown above
