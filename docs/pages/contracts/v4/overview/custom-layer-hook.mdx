# Custom Layer | Hook

Hooks allow developers to add customization to a pool by having callbacks in the various stage of the lifecycle. There are 10 possible callbacks before / after 5 key actions which happen in an AMM. The key actions include pool initialization, swap, addLiquidity, removeLiquidity and Donate

<Callout type="info">
  The image below shows the list of callbacks for concentrated liquidity pool. Liquidity book pool has similar callback with slightly different name. See bin hook here: https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-v4-core/blob/main/src/pool-bin/interfaces/IBinHooks.sol

## Initialize a pool with hook

In order to initialize a pool with the hook, there are a few pointers to note:

1. Have the hook contract deployed and the callback required defined in `getHooksRegistrationBitmap` method

```solidity
/// @dev Below indicate `beforeSwap` callback required
function getHooksRegistrationBitmap() external pure override returns (uint16) {
  return _hooksRegistrationBitmapFrom(
    Permissions({
      beforeInitialize: false,
      afterInitialize: false,
      beforeAddLiquidity: false,
      afterAddLiquidity: false,
      beforeRemoveLiquidity: false,
      afterRemoveLiquidity: false,
      beforeSwap: true, // beforeSwap enabled
      afterSwap: false,
      beforeDonate: false,
      afterDonate: false,
      noOp: false
    })
  );
}
```

2. When initializing the pool, specify the hook contract in the pool key and remember to call `hook.getHooksRegistrationBitmap()` in parameters so the callback are saved in `PoolKey`.

```solidity 
key = PoolKey({
  currency0: currency0,
  currency1: currency1,
  hooks: hook, // hook contract address 
  poolManager: poolManager,
  fee: uint24(3000), // 0.3% swap fee 
  // parameters include hook callback and tickSpacing: 10
  parameters: bytes32(uint256(hook.getHooksRegistrationBitmap())).setTickSpacing(10)
});

/// Initialize the pool 
poolManager.initialize(key, Constants.SQRT_RATIO_1_1, new bytes(0));
```
